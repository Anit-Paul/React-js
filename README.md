# Hooks
React hooks are a fundamental way to manage state and trigger UI updates in functional components!
Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:
- useState lets you track a value and re-render the component when that value changes.
- useEffect lets you run side effects (like data fetching or subscriptions) in response to changes.
- Other hooks like useContext, useReducer, and custom hooks allow even more sophisticated state management and reactivity.
